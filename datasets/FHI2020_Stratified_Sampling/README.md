## How to download the dataset 

I you want to download the dataset using Google Colab, please refer to the [Google Colab Instructions](gcolab_instructions/README.md).

There is also a notebook available that demonstrates how to download the dataset along a RGB pixel extracted which can be used to generate PLSR coefficients. You can find it at [PADs__get_dataset_with_processed_RGB.ipynb](../../gcolab_instructions/PADs__get_dataset_with_processed_RGB.ipynb).
