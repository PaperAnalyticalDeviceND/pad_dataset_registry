# Data Pipeline Overview

This document outlines the main steps of our data pipeline, from initial planning to the final dataset creation and reporting. Each step is designed to ensure that our datasets are carefully planned, well-documented, and prepared for analysis and machine learning applications.

## 1. Planning (PLN)

**Objective:** Define the purpose, scope, and objectives of the dataset. Identify potential data sources and outline the methodology to be used throughout the pipeline.

- **Define project goals:** Clarify what we aim to achieve with the dataset.
- **Identify data sources:** List all projects and datasets that will be utilized, including APIs and databases.
- **Consider constraints:** Note any limitations or special considerations, such as data privacy concerns.

## 2. Data Exploration (EXP)

**Objective:** Explore and analyze the data available from each identified source to understand its structure, quality, and potential usefulness.

- **Automate data queries:** Use scripts to efficiently fetch data.
- **Visualize and summarize:** Employ statistical and visualization tools to analyze the data.
- **Document findings:** Keep detailed notes on data characteristics and any issues identified.

## 3. Data Preprocessing (PREP)

**Objective:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is standardized, free of errors, and ready for integration.

- **Clean data:** Implement functions to address missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
- **Standardize formats:** Ensure data from different sources adheres to a consistent format.
- **Intermediate storage:** Save processed data in an efficient format for easy access in later stages.

## 4. Dataset Compilation & Partitioning (COMP)

**Objective:** Integrate data from various sources into a cohesive dataset. Split the data into development and test sets to prepare for model training and evaluation.

- **Merge data sources:** Combine data from different projects into a unified dataset.
- **Stratify data:** Use stratified sampling to maintain target variable distributions across splits.
- **Version control:** Utilize DVC for dataset versioning and management.

## 5. Reporting and Documentation (RPT)

**Objective:** Generate comprehensive reports detailing dataset characteristics, preprocessing steps taken, and any insights gained during exploration.

- **Automate reporting:** Create templates for generating reports that summarize key dataset aspects.
- **Maintain metadata:** Store detailed metadata alongside the dataset for easy reference.
- **Ensure accessibility:** Make reports and datasets readily available to stakeholders, with clear documentation on access and use.

## Versioning and Updates

This pipeline is subject to revisions and updates as our project evolves. Contributors are encouraged to document any changes to the methodology, data sources, or processing steps in this document, following the outlined naming conventions and organizational structure.
