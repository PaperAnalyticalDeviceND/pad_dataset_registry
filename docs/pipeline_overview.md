# Data Pipeline Overview

This document provides an overview of our data pipeline, detailing the structured approach we take from the conception of a dataset to its final form, ready for analysis and machine learning applications. Our pipeline is designed to ensure thorough planning, comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing, strategic dataset compilation and partitioning, and meticulous reporting and documentation.

## 1. Planning (PLN)

The Planning step lays the foundation of our data project. At this stage, we clearly define the purpose, scope, and objectives of the dataset we intend to build. Identifying potential data sources is crucial here, as it sets the direction for data collection. We also outline the methodologies that will guide our work throughout the pipeline, taking into account any constraints or special considerations such as data privacy and availability. This preparatory step ensures that all subsequent actions are aligned with the project's goals and are executed efficiently.

## 2. Data Exploration (EXP)

During the Data Exploration phase, we delve into the data from each identified source to understand its structure, quality, and relevance to our objectives. This involves automating data queries to efficiently gather information, employing statistical and visualization tools to unearth insights, and meticulously documenting our findings. The goal is to assess the usability of the data for our project and identify any potential issues early on, guiding the strategies for cleaning and preprocessing.

## 3. Data Preprocessing (PREP)

The Data Preprocessing step is where we clean and standardize the data, making it ready for integration and analysis. This includes addressing any inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers identified during exploration, as well as standardizing formats to ensure data from different sources can be seamlessly merged. Processed data is saved in an efficient format, balancing the need for speed with storage considerations, to facilitate easy access in later stages.

## 4. Dataset Compilation & Partitioning (COMP)

At the Dataset Compilation & Partitioning stage, we bring together data from various projects into a unified dataset, ready for modeling and analysis. This involves not just the technical aspects of merging datasets but also strategic decisions on how to best represent the data to meet our analytical needs. We then split the data into development and test sets, ensuring that the distribution of key variables is maintained across these subsets to allow for effective model training and validation. Version control practices, such as using DVC, are implemented to manage dataset versions and facilitate reproducibility.

## 5. Reporting and Documentation (RPT)

Finally, the Reporting and Documentation step encapsulates the entire process, offering a comprehensive account of the dataset and its creation. Automated reporting tools summarize key aspects of the dataset, from its size and structure to the specific preprocessing steps applied. Detailed metadata is maintained alongside the dataset, providing a reference that elucidates its origins, structure, and any limitations. This documentation ensures that the dataset is not just a collection of data points but a well-understood and accessible resource for stakeholders.

## Conclusion

Our data pipeline, from Planning to Reporting and Documentation, is designed to be iterative and flexible, accommodating changes and updates as our project evolves. Each step is carefully documented, ensuring that our methodologies are transparent and our datasets are robust and reliable. By adhering to this structured approach, we aim to facilitate the development of high-quality datasets that can effectively support analysis and decision-making processes.
